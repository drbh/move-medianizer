A simple move program that gets prices updates and returns a medianized value. This is mainly a way for me to learn more about Aptos and Move and should not be used in production.

Run tests
```bash
cargo test
# Running Move unit tests
# [ PASS    ] 0xe110::Pricer::sender_can_update_price
# [ PASS    ] 0xe110::PricerTests::sender_can_update_round
# [ PASS    ] 0xe110::PricerTests::sender_can_update_round_even
# Test result: OK. Total tests: 3; passed: 3; failed: 0
```
